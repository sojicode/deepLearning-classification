## DeepLearning - Classification

Use the **TensorFlow & Keras** and train my first neural network(`classification`) to learn how to use Keras to create and train a neural network model (in particular, a Multi-layer Feed- Forward network in this exercise).

### Goal
* To run various model configurations and hyperparameter values to empirically examine their effects in learning

* To experience searching for an optimal model/hyperparameter setting for neural networks (i.e., a journey to tune the model)

### Experiment to search for an `optimal model`
> - Number of nodes in hidden layers
> - Number of hidden layers
> - Activation function for hidden layers
> - Learning rate (eta; set through Keras Optimizer) Mini-batch size (batch_size in fit())
> - Regularization methods (set through Keras Regularizer) Dropout (using Keras Corelayer)
